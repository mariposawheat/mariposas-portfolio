<h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>

<p>
    <br>
    <br>
<strong>Purpose:</strong> This PWP's purpose is for me to tell people who I am, show off what skills I have right now, and show this portfolio off to potential employers,
    <br>
    or professional peers to show to.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Audience:</strong> This website's audience is for potential employers, potential clients, and even made to show off to my family at the end of this class.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Goal:</strong> My goal for my PWP would be to acquire employment, full-time, part-time, or an internship even.
    <br>
    I also want it to showcase my work as well, such as my artistic ability (digitally) or even hobby baking.
